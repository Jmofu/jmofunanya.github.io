What emerging technology did you choose? How is AI being used to support this technology? 

The emerging technology that has caught my attention is Quantum Computing. This field combines computer science, physics, and mathematics to harness the principles of quantum mechanics, allowing for more efficient solutions to complex problems compared to classical computers.
With the integration of AI, quantum computing has become faster and more accurate. AI enhances quantum computing by optimizing it for practical applications such as material science and complex simulations. For instance, AI aids in the simulation of quantum materials and chemical reactions, which is beneficial for drug discovery, energy storage, and the design of advanced materials.
Moreover, machine learning is incorporated into quantum computing to make precise predictions, improve performance and stability, and detect and correct errors caused by qubit instability.

What previous solutions were being used in place of AI? How has AI replaced or will soon replace these solutions? 

Prior to the advent of artificial intelligence, quantum systems were optimized through classical computing techniques and mathematical models. Classical methods, such as Grover’s algorithm and Shor’s algorithm, were employed to solve quantum problems by relying on established rules and mathematical equations rather than adaptive learning processes.
Before the emergence of artificial intelligence, quantum error correction relied on predefined codes that required significant manual adjustment. These conventional methods encountered difficulties in scaling efficiently due to increasing qubit noise and hardware limitations.
AI integration has significantly advanced quantum computing by optimizing processes, improving simulations, and enhancing error correction, thereby making quantum systems more efficient and scalable.
